This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell: using an undefined variable. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to use the `undefined` value in a computation. This is a frequent mistake, especially when dealing with lazy evaluation and potentially incomplete data structures.
